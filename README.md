This application allows you to perform various actions on the guest list, such as adding, deleting, marking a person as 'attending' or 'not attending' and subsequently saving the updated information to the database.

### TODO List üìù

- [x] Adding a guest using separate first name and last name fields
  - [x] The first name input needs to have a related label containing `First name`
  - [x] The last name input needs to have a related label containing `Last name`
  - [x] A guest should be created upon pressing <kbd>Return</kbd> in the last name input
  - [x] After a guest is created, both fields need to be cleared again
  - [x] Newly created guests should be set as **not attending** by default
  - [x] Each guest (all content and form fields) should be contained inside a div element with the attribute `data-test-id="guest"`
- [x] Deleting a guest with a button that **either**:
  - [x] Contains the text `Remove`
  - [x] Has an `aria-label` attribute which starts with `Remove` (eg. `Remove <first name> <last name>`)
- [x] Setting a guest as "attending" by clicking on a checkbox
  - [x] The checkbox needs to have an `aria-label` which contains the text `attending` (eg. `<first name> <last name> attending status`) - the text can be uppercase or lowercase
